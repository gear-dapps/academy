We provide a range of homework assignments. You'll begin with stimulating quizzes and then progress to exciting programming tasks.

For each completed assignment, you'll receive points and a chance to own a distinctive NFT from our exclusive collection.

The programming assignments adhere to specific guidelines, as highlighted below, for GitHub repositories, names, pull requests (PR), reviews and regular homework.

Guidelines for assignments: 
- You **should** have one repository for each homework.
- The repository name **should** include the `-gear-academy` suffix, for example, `myname-gear-academy`.
- Exclude **build artifacts** such as `node_modules`, `target`, and editor files from the repository.
- Place each homework inside a folder named after the corresponding block, such as `hello-world`, `escrow`, `tamagotchi`, `state`, etc.
- **Submit** each homework as a separate pull request (PR) from a feature branch derived from the `master` or another working branch. Use the block name and lesson number (e.g., `helloworld-1`, `lone-state-2`, `auction-3`, `nft-marketplace-4`) in the PR title.
- If any changes are requested, make updates **within the existing branch and PR**.
- Each PR **should** be merged to the `master` after the homework is accepted.
- **Do not** include any scaffolding code, private keys, or passwords in the PR.
- Ensure the tests and build process **pass** successfully;
- You **may** use `git` from the command line instead of relying on the GitHub web interfac.
