We offer various types of homework assignments. Firstly, you will be presented with engaging quizzes. Following that, we will introduce programming tasks.

Every completed task will earn you points and provide an opportunity to acquire a unique NFT from our collection.

Please note that the following rules apply to programming assignments: GitHub repos, names, pull requests (PR), reviews, and homework.

- **SHOULD** be one repo for every homework;
- repo name **SHOULD** contain `-gear-academy` suffix, e.g. `myname-gear-academy`;
- repo **SHOULD** exclude build artifacts like `node_modules`, `target`, editor files, etc.;
- each homework **SHOULD** be inside the folder named as a block (`hello-world`, `escrow`, `tamagotchi`, `state`, etc);
- each homework **SHOULD** be a separate PR (helps to review, and add comments) from the feature branch (branched from the `master` or any other working branch) with a block name and a lesson number (`helloworld-1`, `lone-state-2`, `auction-3`, `nft-marketplace-4`, etc.) to the `master`;
- if any changes were requested, updates **SHOULD** be done inside the existing branch and PR;
- each PR **SHOULD** be merged to the `master` after the homework is accepted;
- every scaffolding code **SHOULD NOT** be included in PR - private keys, passwords **SHOULD NOT** be included in PR;
- test & build **SHOULD** pass;
- **MAY** work with `git` from the command line, not using the GitHub web interface.
