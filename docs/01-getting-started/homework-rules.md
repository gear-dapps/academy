We provide a range of homework assignments. You'll begin with stimulating quizzes and then progress to exciting programming tasks.

You receive points for each completed assignment and a chance to own a distinctive NFT from our exclusive collection.

The programming assignments adhere to specific guidelines for GitHub repositories, names, pull requests (PR), reviews and regular homework.

- **SHOULD** be one repo for every homework;
- Repo name **SHOULD** contain `-gear-academy` suffix, e.g. `myname-gear-academy`;
- Repo **SHOULD** exclude build artifacts like `node_modules`, `target`, editor files, etc.;
- Each homework **SHOULD** be inside the folder named as a block (`hello-world`, `escrow`, `tamagotchi`, `state`, etc);
- Each homework **SHOULD** be a separate PR (helps to review, and add comments) from the feature branch (branched from the `master` or any other working branch) with a block name and a lesson number (`helloworld-1`, `lone-state-2`, `auction-3`, `nft-marketplace-4`, etc.) to the `master`;
- If any changes were requested, updates **SHOULD** be done inside the existing branch and PR;
- Each PR **SHOULD** be merged to the `master` after the homework is accepted;
- Every scaffolding code **SHOULD NOT** be included in PR - private keys, passwords **SHOULD NOT** be included in PR;
- Test & build **SHOULD** pass;
- **MAY** work with `git` from the command line, not using the GitHub web interface.
