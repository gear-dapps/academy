# Gear Smart Contract Developer

Our academy will begin with the simplest hello world example. From the first lesson, you will start writing a Tamagotchi contract, which will be expanded and acquire new functionality as you progress through the academy. In the next lessons, we will explore various popular standards and decentralized applications.

We will also learn the Gear distinctive features that are not found on any other blockchains. Your Tamagotchi contract will be able to check its status itself and communicate with the owner by sending him various messages.

We will also write a shop contract where you can equip your Tamagotchi with various attributes.

The final contract will be a Tamagotchi battle contract in which your Tamagotchi will fight with each other. The course will be interesting, informative and interactive.
