# Gear Smart Contract Developer

Our academy lessons begin with a straightforward "Hello, World!" example. Right from the first lesson, you will create a Tamagotchi contract, which will progressively expand and gain new functionalities as you advance through the academy. Subsequent exercises will explore popular standards and decentralized applications.

We will also learn the Gear distinctive features that are not found on any other blockchains. Your Tamagotchi contract will be able to check its status itself and communicate with the owner by sending him various messages.

We will also write a shop contract where you can equip your Tamagotchi with various attributes.

The final contract will be a Tamagotchi battle contract in which your Tamagotchi will fight with each other. The course will be interesting, informative and interactive.
