# Gear Smart Contract Developer

Our academy lessons begin with a straightforward "Hello, World!" example. Right from the first exercise, you will create a Tamagotchi contract, which will progressively expand and gain new functionalities as you advance through the academy.

The course also features a shop contract, allowing you to equip your Tamagotchi with unique traits.

At the end of the lessons, your Tamagotchi will compete in exciting battles against other participants in the Tamagotchi battle contract. The course guarantees an engaging, informative and interactive experience.
