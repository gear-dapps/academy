# Gear Smart Contract Developer

Welcome to the Gear Academy for smart contract development!

During the course, you'll learn fundamental blockchain development concepts, build smart contracts and explore Gear's robust features.

The Academy lessons begin with a simple "Hello World!" example before shifting gears to create a Tamagotchi contract. You'll progressively improve your Tamagotchi in subsequent tutorials using your new skills.

Among the features you should expect from building your Tamagotchi is its ability to check its status independently and communicate with its owners using various messages.

The course also features a shop contract to equip your Tamagotchi with unique traits for battle. And, yes, there's a dedicated lesson on Tamagotchi battle preparation because you'll have your Tamagotchi competing in exciting competitions against other participations.

Prepare for an engaging, informative and interactive experience in the Gear Academy!
