A crypto wallet is like a digital piggy bank for your cryptocurrency. Just like you keep your physical money in a piggy bank, you use a crypto wallet to store and keep track of your digital money. The wallet has a unique address that you can use to send and receive cryptocurrency. You can access your wallet using a special code called a private key.

Keeping this private key safe is essential because anyone with it can access and spend your cryptocurrency. There are different types of crypto wallets, such as software wallets that you install on your computer or mobile device and hardware wallets that look like USB drives and can be kept in a safe place.
