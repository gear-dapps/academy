Crypto wallets are digital tools used to store and manage cryptocurrencies. They enable users to securely access their crypto assets and perform functions like sending, receiving, and monitoring holdings. These wallets consist of two main components: public and private keys.

Public keys serve as the account address, allowing others to send cryptocurrencies to the wallet. Private keys, on the other hand, grant ownership and control over the funds stored in the wallet.

There are various forms of crypto wallets available. Software wallets, for example, are installed on devices like computers or smartphones. They offer convenience and accessibility to users.

Another option is hardware wallets, physical devices designed to provide enhanced security and protection against hacking attempts. Online wallets, accessible through web-based services, offer the advantage of accessibility from any device with an internet connection.
