Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency, which is a form of digital money. It was created to allow people to make transactions without needing a central authority or bank. Just like physical money, you can use Bitcoin to buy goods and services or trade it for other currencies. Transactions with Bitcoin are recorded on a public ledger called a blockchain, which helps ensure the system's security and transparency. People can store their Bitcoin in a digital wallet and use a unique address to send and receive it. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be created and is still one of the most well-known and widely used.

Also, it is more accessible to people in countries with unstable currencies or limited access to traditional banking services.
