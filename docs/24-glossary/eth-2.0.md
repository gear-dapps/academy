Ethereum 2.0 (also known as ETH 2.0 or Serenity) is a planned upgrade to the Ethereum network to improve its scalability, security, and energy efficiency.

One of the main changes in Ethereum 2.0 is the introduction of a new consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake (PoS), which replaces the current mechanism called Proof of Work (PoW). PoW requires significant computational power to process transactions. At the same time, PoS allows users to "stake" or lock up their Ether as collateral to validate transactions. This reduces the computational power needed, making the network more energy-efficient and sustainable.

Another change in Ethereum 2.0 is the introduction of shard chains, which will allow the network to process many more transactions in parallel, improving its scalability. This means that ETH 2.0 should be able to handle many times more transactions per second than ETH 1.0, which will make the network faster and more efficient.
