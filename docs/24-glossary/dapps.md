dApps, short for decentralized applications, are the future of digital innovation. Unlike their traditional counterparts, dApps are built upon a collaborative network of computers, ensuring unprecedented security and resilience against potential threats.

These applications serve diverse purposes, from captivating online marketplaces to immersive gaming platforms and vibrant social networks. With dApps, you become the master of your data, liberated from the control of central authorities or corporations. Experience the freedom to access and manage your information effortlessly through a web browser or mobile device.

It's like a digital version of a board game. A board game has a set of rules, objectives, and a way to win or lose. And just like multiple players playing a board game, various users can also use a dApp. Examples of dApps are OpenBazaar, a decentralized marketplace, and CryptoKitties, a game where you can buy, sell and breed virtual cats.
