dApps are short for decentralized applications, which run on a decentralized network, like the Ethereum network. Unlike traditional apps that run on a single central server, dApps are built on a network of many computers that work together. This makes dApps more secure because there's no single point of failure, and it's harder for someone to hack or manipulate the system. dApps can be used for online marketplaces, gaming platforms, and social networks. When you use a dApp, you control your data and information. You don't have to rely on a central authority or company to manage or access it. Like traditional apps, dApps can be accessed using a web browser or a mobile device.

It's like a digital version of a board game. A board game has a set of rules, objectives, and a way to win or lose. And just like multiple players playing a board game, various users can also use a dApp. Some examples of dApps are OpenBazaar, a decentralized marketplace, and CryptoKitties, a game where you can buy, sell and breed virtual cats.
