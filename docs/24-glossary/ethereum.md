Ethereum is a type of cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin but has additional features. It was created to be more than just a digital currency, and it's designed to support decentralized applications and smart contracts. This means that developers can use Ethereum to build new decentralized systems and applications that run on the Ethereum network. Transactions on the Ethereum network are processed by its own currency, Ether, which can be used to buy goods and services or traded for other currencies. Like Bitcoin, people can store and send Ether using a digital wallet and a unique address. Ethereum is often called the "world computer" because it has the potential to support a wide range of decentralized applications and services. And just like how computer programs can be written in different languages, Ethereum also has its own programming language called "Solidity".

Ethereum is like a digital version of a game platform where different games and applications can be built and run. The platform itself has its value.

Another analogy is a digital version of a building block set. Building block sets can be used to create various structures and combined with other building block sets to make even more complex structures.
