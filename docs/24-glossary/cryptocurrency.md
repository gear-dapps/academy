A cryptocurrency is a type of digital money that uses cryptography to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. It operates independently of a central bank and can be used to buy goods and services or traded for other currencies. Some examples of cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. 

People can store and send their cryptocurrency using a digital wallet. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger called a blockchain. Cryptocurrency is still a relatively new concept, but more and more people are using it as an alternative to traditional money.

It's like a digital version of a game token where each token is a cryptocurrency and can be used to transact or trade with other players.
