1. Implement the `confirm_delivery` function. The function should:

    - Check that [`msg::source()`](https://docs.gear.rs/gstd/msg/fn.source.html) is a buyer;
    - Check that the escrow state is `AwaitingDelivery`;
    - Sends the funds to the seller (use [`msg::send()`](https://docs.gear.rs/gstd/msg/fn.send.html) function);
    - Set the escrow state to `Closed`;
    - Send a reply message about successful delivery confirmation.

2. Write tests for the written function:

    - `confirm_delivery` test that tests the successful contract execution;

    Note that the contract sends a message with value to a seller and the user messages are stored in their individual mailbox. To get the value from these messages, it's necessary to claim the value from the mailbox.

    In `gtest`, you can use the function [`System::claim_value_from_mailbox`](https://docs.gear.rs/gtest/struct.System.html#method.claim_value_from_mailbox). After claiming the value, check the seller's balance and make sure that funds were transferred to his account.

    - `confirm_delivery_failures` test that tests all panics in the escrow contract.

3. Next, we return to the Tamagotchi contract you started writing in the previous lesson.

Letâ€™s expand the Tamagochi state by adding the following field to its structure:

- The Tamagotchi owner (it can be an account that initializes the Tamagotchi contract);
- `Mood`: `Fed` (from 1 to 10000), `Happy` (from 1 to 10000) and `Rested` (from 1 to 10000). These values must be set to non-zero when initializing the Tamagotchi contract. Also, you should define the following constants:
- `HUNGER_PER_BLOCK = 1`: how much Tamagotchi becomes hungry for the block;
- `ENERGY_PER_BLOCK = 2` - how much Tamagotchi loses energy per block;
- `BOREDOM_PER_BLOCK = 2` - how bored Tamagotchi gets per block;
- `FILL_PER_SLEEP = 1000` - how much energy Tamagotchi gets per sleep;
- `FILL_PER_FEED = 1000` - how much Tamagotchi becomes full during feeding;
- `FILL_PER_ENTERTAINMENT = 1000` - how much Tamagotchi becomes happy during feeding;
- The Tamagotchi also has to accept messages: `Sleep`, `Feed` and `Play`;
- Think of logic for calculating the levels of `Fed`, `Happy` and `Rested`.

You need to take into account the number of blocks in which the Tamagotchi last ate, had fun or slept. For this, you can use the function [`exec::block_height()`](https://docs.gear.rs/gstd/exec/fn.block_height.html) from the module exec of `gstd` library.

4. Now upload your contract to the blockchain and run the frontend application. Choose **Lesson 2**.

Now you can feed your Tamagotchi, play with it and send it to sleep.

The metadata must meet the following requirements to ensure the contract aligns with the frontend:

```rust title="io/src/lib.rs"
pub struct ProgramMetadata;

impl Metadata for ProgramMetadata {
   type Init = In<String>;
   type Reply = ();
   type Others = ();
   type Signal = ();
   type Handle = InOut<TmgAction, TmgEvent>;
   type State = Tamagotchi;
}

#[derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)]
pub enum TmgAction {
   Name,
   Age,
   Feed,
   Play,
   Sleep,
}

#[derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)]
pub enum TmgEvent {
   Name(String),
   Age(u64),
   Fed,
   Entertained,
   Slept,
}

#[derive(Default, Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)]
pub struct Tamagotchi {
   pub name: String,
   pub date_of_birth: u64,
   pub owner: ActorId,
   pub fed: u64,
   pub fed_block: u64,
   pub entertained: u64,
   pub entertained_block: u64,
   pub rested: u64,
   pub rested_block: u64,
}
```
