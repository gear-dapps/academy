# Course content

This course is a continuation of the basic course. Let's delve deeper into the implementation of programs using Gear technologies, in particular how programs can communicate with each other, receive and process requests, as well as how to handle cases when one of the parties does not respond

The course material is structured into three sections:

1. Message Acquisition and Processing:
- Detailed examination of the handle_reply() function.
- Acquisition of skills in processing messages received as responses.
- Testing of the developed program.

2. Asynchronous Logic Utilizing the Waiting List:
- Introduction to the wait() and wake() functions.
- Mastery of halting message processing and awakening it as necessary.
- Analysis of scenarios where responses are not received and resolution using the wait_for() function.
- Testing of the implemented programs.

3. Handling of Delayed Messages:
- In-depth exploration of delayed messages.
- Resolution of issues related to lack of response through the use of pending messages.
- Testing of the program featuring pending messages.
