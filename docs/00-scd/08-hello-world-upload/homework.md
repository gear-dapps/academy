Let's write a smart contract for a Tamagotchi game that will store the Tamagotchi's name and date of birth.

## Smart contract

0️⃣ Don't forget to fork the [template repository](https://github.com/gear-foundation/dapps-template-gear-academy) and create a new branch for your homework. All changes should be made in the `01-tamagotchi` folder.

1️⃣ Add `name` and `date_of_birth` fields to the `Tamagotchi` struct. The `date_of_birth` field will keep a timestamp in milliseconds since the beginning of the Unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).

```rust title="01-tamagotchi/io/src/lib.rs"
#[derive(Default, Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)]
pub struct Tamagotchi {
    // highlight-start
    pub name: String,
    pub date_of_birth: u64,
    // highlight-end
}
```

2️⃣ Your Tamagotchi program should accept the following messages:

- `Name` - the program provides the name of the Tamagotchi;
- `Age` - the program provides information about the Tamagotchi's age.

```rust title="01-tamagotchi/io/src/lib.rs"
#[derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)]
pub enum TmgAction {
    // highlight-start
    Name,
    Age,
    // highlight-end
}
```

3️⃣ Program should return the following events:

- `Name(String)` - the reply to the `Age` action contains the name of the Tamagotchi;
- `Age(u64)` - the reply to the `Name` action contains the age of the Tamagotchi (in milliseconds).

```rust title="01-tamagotchi/io/src/lib.rs"
#[derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)]
pub enum TmgEvent {
    Name(String),
    Age(u64),
}
```

4️⃣ To connect your Tamagotchi contract to the frontend application, ensure the metadata is as follows:

```rust title="01-tamagotchi/io/src/lib.rs"
pub struct ProgramMetadata;

impl Metadata for ProgramMetadata {
    // highlight-start
    type Init = In<String>;
    type Handle = InOut<TmgAction, TmgEvent>;
    type State = Tamagotchi;
    // highlight-end
    type Reply = ();
    type Others = ();
    type Signal = ();
}
```

5️⃣ During initialization, set the Tamagotchi's name and date of birth and send a reply confirming successful initialization. You can modify the birth date by utilizing the [`exec::block_timestamp()`](https://docs.gear.rs/gstd/exec/fn.block_timestamp.html) function from the `gstd` library. This function represents the block generation time in milliseconds measured since the beginning of the Unix epoch.

```rust title="01-tamagotchi/src/lib.rs"
#[no_mangle]
extern "C" fn init() {
    // highlight-next-line
    // ...
}
```

6️⃣ Add the code to the `handle` function that will process the `Name` and `Age` actions. The `Name` action should return the Tamagotchi's name, and the `Age` action should return the Tamagotchi's age in milliseconds.

```rust title="01-tamagotchi/src/lib.rs"
#[no_mangle]
extern "C" fn handle() {
    // highlight-next-line
    // ...
}
```

7️⃣ Add the state function to your program that returns the instance of the `Tamaogtchi` struct.

```rust title="01-tamagotchi/src/lib.rs"
#[no_mangle]
extern "C" fn state() {
    // highlight-next-line
    // ...
}
```

8️⃣ Complete the test that checks the initialization of the Tamagotchi contract and the correctness of the `handle` function.

```rust title="01-tamagotchi/tests/smoke.rs"
#[test]
fn smoke_test() {
    let system = System::new();
    let program = Program::current(&system);

    // highlight-next-line
    // ...
}
```

Then upload your contract to the **Vara Stable Testnet** at [https://idea.gear-tech.io](https://idea.gear-tech.io).

## Frontend

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). Ensure you've installed the latest version of Node.js.

- Then install `yarn`:

    ```bash
    npm i -g yarn
    ```

- In the `frontend` directory, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    yarn
    yarn dev
    ```

You'll find the [`.env.example`](https://github.com/gear-foundation/dapps-template-gear-academy/blob/master/frontend/.env.example) file. Within the file, observe the line:

```
VITE_NODE_ADDRESS=wss://testnet.vara.rs
```

This line signifies the application operates on the Vara Testnet node.

You can also [run a local node](https://wiki.gear-tech.io/docs/node/dev-net), upload a Tamagotchi contract and work with contracts on a local node by indicating:

```
VITE_NODE_ADDRESS=ws://localhost:9944
```

It also contains other variables which we'll explore in upcoming lessons.

For the first lesson, edit your own `.env` file and check whether the `VITE_NODE_ADDRESS` variable is set to `wss://testnet.vara.rs` there.

After running the `yarn dev` command and opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser, you'll see the following window:

Also, you'll find the frontend deployed in your GitHub Pages at the corresponding address (something similar to [https://mynick.github.io/myname-gear-academy/](https://mynick.github.io/myname-gear-academy/)).
