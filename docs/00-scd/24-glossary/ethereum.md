Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform changing how applications are built and executed. It enables the creation of smart contracts, self-executing agreements with predefined rules encoded into the blockchain. These contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries, enhancing transparency and reducing costs.

Developers utilize Ethereum's programming language, Solidity, to construct decentralized applications (dApps). These dApps can encompass various use cases, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, and gaming.

ETH is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. It serves as a medium of exchange, incentivizing participants to validate transactions and execute computational tasks within the network. This process is known as mining or, more accurately, validating blocks.

Ethereum introduced the concept of gas, a measure of computational effort required to execute operations on the network. Gas fees, paid in ETH, ensure the network remains secure and prevents spam or malicious activities.

Ethereum empowers developers to build decentralized applications, facilitates peer-to-peer transactions, and promotes innovation in the blockchain space through smart contracts and a robust ecosystem of dApps.
