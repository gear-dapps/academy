Blockchain is like a digital notebook recording crucial information and keeping it safe. The notebook is split into "blocks" pages. Everyone in a group can see the information recorded on each page.

Each time someone adds new information, everyone in the group approves and adds it to the next page. This makes it difficult to change the information or cheat because many people watch and track what's happening. This is why people use blockchain for things like money and essential data.
