Ethereum 2.0 is a major upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain network. It is designed to improve scalability, security and sustainability.

One of the main changes in Ethereum 2.0 is a new consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake (PoS), which replaces the Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism. PoW requires significant computational power to process transactions. At the same time, PoS allows users to "stake" or lock up their Ether as collateral to validate transactions. This reduces the computational power needed, making the network more energy-efficient and sustainable.

Another change in Ethereum 2.0 is the introduction of shard chains, allowing the network to process many more transactions in parallel, improving its scalability. ETH 2.0 enables handling significantly more transactions per second than ETH 1.0, resulting in a faster and more efficient network.
