The Polkadot.js browser extension is the original application created by Parity Technologies for managing Substate accounts. This method involves installing the Polkadot.js plugin and using it as a "virtual vault" separate from your browser to store your private keys and sign transactions.

1. You can install the extension via the following links:

    - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polkadot%7Bjs%7D-extension/mopnmbcafieddcagagdcbnhejhlodfdd?hl=en)
    - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-extension)

2. Open the extension by clicking on the logo in the menu bar.

3. Click the large plus button to create a new account. Alternatively, you can navigate to the smaller plus icon in the top right and select "Create New Account".

4. Save the seed phrase in a safe place using the security advice at the beginning of this guide.

    Specify your Polkadot.js account name and provide a password to facilitate secure transaction processing. Click "Add the account with the generated seed".

    Specify the name of your account and a strong password for making transactions. Click "Add the account with the generated seed".

:::note

The password you choose here encrypts your account's information. You must re-enter this password for any outgoing transaction or when cryptographically signing a message. It is stored locally on the browser extension.

:::

You've now successfully created a new account using the Polkadot.js browser extension.
