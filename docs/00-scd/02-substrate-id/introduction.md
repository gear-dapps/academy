## Creating a Substrate ID

**Substrate ID** (or SS58) is a unique identifier representing an account's address in the Substrate ecosystem.

Creating a Substrate ID is crucial for secure and accurate data transfer among members of the Substrate ecosystem. It comprises a network-specific prefix and a public key that forms the account's address.
