An account represents an identity, which can be a person or an organization capable of making transactions or holding funds. Users can upload smart contracts and interact with them through transactions in blockchain networks built on Vara network. To do this, users need to connect a Substrate account. The Gear Idea portal can work with Substrate accounts in connected Gear-powered networks. This account can also hold funds and make transactions in any network of the DotSama ecosystem and [beyond](https://docs.substrate.io/fundamentals/accounts-addresses-keys/).

You can set up your account in different ways depending on your device.

Two main features make up an account - an address and a key:

- An address is the public aspect of the account. It's like a location you can share with others to send and receive transactions.
- A key is the private part of the account. It allows you, as the account owner, to access your address. You can only access your account with your private key (a mnemonic phrase, seed or the account's JSON file with a password).

:::note Seed phrase

Your seed or mnemonic phrase is the key to your account. If you lose seed, you will lose access to your account. Store your seed in secure places like encrypted hard drives, non-digital devices or paper. Never share your private key.

:::

:::note JSON

The JSON file is a backup of your account encrypted with a password. You can import/restore your account in any wallet using JSON. Without a password, you cannot regain access to your account. If you use JSON, store the file and passwords in a safe place.

Example for the well-known **Alice** account:

- Seed phrase: `bottom drive obey lake curtain smoke basket hold race lonely fit walk//Alice`
- Private key: `0xe5be9a5092b81bca64be81d212e7f2f9eba183bb7a90954f7b76361f6edb5c0a`
- Public key: `0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d`
- Substrate ID (address): `5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY`
