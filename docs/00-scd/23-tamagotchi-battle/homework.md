Your coursework will involve the following task:

- Add more fighting attributes to the store contract;
- Determine the power of these attributes. You can also add the opportunity to upgrade various attributes (that will also require extending the logic of the store contract);
- Allow the player to choose which weapon he will fight or defend during the turn;
- It is also possible to add the ability to Tamagotchi to move sideways;
- Be creative and examine other ways to make the game more interesting.

Please attach a link to the pull request (PR) in your repo with your Tamagotchi contract. Also, please paste your Tamagotchi program address as in the example below:
