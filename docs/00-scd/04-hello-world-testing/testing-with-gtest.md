In this part of our course, you'll learn how to test smart contracts in the Rust programming language using the Gear [`gtest`](https://docs.gear.rs/gtest/) library.

Here's what we'll cover:

- Creating a test file
- Defining a test function
- Initializing the environment to run the program
- Sending messages to the program
- Checking test results

Testing smart contracts is crucial when developing decentralized applications. We'll use the Gear [`gtest`](https://docs.gear.rs/gtest/) library for our program's logic testing.

Let's start by creating a new directory called `tests` at the top level of our project directory, next to the `src` directory.

We'll create the `hello_world_test.rs` file to write tests for our contract in the directory.

```bash
mkdir tests
cd tests
touch hello_world_test.rs
```

In our test file, we'll import the necessary types from the [`gtest`](https://docs.gear.rs/gtest/) library, such as [`Log`](https://docs.gear.rs/gtest/struct.Log.html), [`Program`](https://docs.gear.rs/gtest/struct.Program.html) and [`System`](https://docs.gear.rs/gtest/struct.System.html).

We'll also define a test function:

```rust title="tests/hello_world_test.rs"
use gtest::{Log, Program, System};

#[test]
fn hello_test() {}
```

Before testing our smart contract, we'll create an environment for running programs using the [`System`](https://docs.gear.rs/gtest/struct.System.html) structure from `gtest`. The `System` emulates the node behavior:

```rust
let sys = System::new();
```

Next, we'll create a mockup of our program using the [`Program`](https://docs.gear.rs/gtest/struct.Program.html) structure from `gtest`. There are two ways to create a program mockup:
- From a file by its path
- By pointing to the program itself (current program)

To create a program mockup from a Wasm file:

```rust
let program = Program::from_file(&sys,
    "./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hello_world.wasm");
```

To create a program mockup from the program itself:

```rust
let program = Program::current(&sys);
```

The uploaded program has its own id. You can specify the program id manually using the [`Program::from_file_with_id`](https://docs.gear.rs/gtest/struct.Program.html#method.from_file_with_id) constructor.

If you don't specify the program id, the id of the first initialized program will be `0x010000…00` (32-byte _one_, LSB first), and the next program initialized without an id specification will have an id of `0x020000…00` (32-byte _two_, LSB first) and so on.

In the next step, we'll send messages to our program.

- To send a message to the program, call one of two `Program` methods: [`send`](https://docs.gear.rs/gtest/struct.Program.html#method.send) or [`send_bytes`](https://docs.gear.rs/gtest/struct.Program.html#method.send_bytes). The difference between them is similar to `gstd` functions [`msg::send`](https://docs.gear.rs/gstd/msg/fn.send.html) and [`msg::send_bytes`](https://docs.gear.rs/gstd/msg/fn.send_bytes.html).
- The first argument in these functions is a sender id, and the second is a message payload.
- You can specify the sender id as a hex, byte array (`[u8; 32]`), string or `u64`. However, you can't send a message from the id already taken by the program!
- The first message sent to the `Program` structure is always the initialization message, regardless of whether the program has an `init` function or not. In our case, we can use any message. However, let's include the `init` function in our program and observe if that message reaches the program.

```rust title="src/lib.rs"
#![no_std]
use gstd::{msg, prelude::*, debug};

#[no_mangle]
extern "C" fn handle() {
    msg::reply(String::from("Hello"), 0)
        .expect("Error in sending a reply message");
}

#[no_mangle]
extern "C" fn init() {
    let init_message: String = msg::load()
        .expect("Can't load init message");
    debug!("Program was initialized with message {:?}",
        init_message);
}
```

In our test function, we can send a message to the program using the `Program::send` function:

```rust title="tests/hello_world_test.rs"
#[test]
fn hello_test() {
    let sys = System::new();
    sys.init_logger();
    let program = Program::current(&sys);
    program.send(2, String::from("INIT MESSAGE"));
}
```

:::note

We added `sys.init_logger()` to initialize printing logs into stdout and sent a message from the user with id 2 (id 2 transforms to `ActorId` equal to `0x020000…00` ).

:::

We can then run our test using `cargo test`:

```bash
cargo test --release
```

If everything is working correctly, we should see the debug message in our console:

```
[DEBUG hello_test] Program was initialized with message "INIT MESSAGE"
test hello_test ... ok
```

Sending functions in the `gtest` library will return [`RunResult`](https://docs.gear.rs/gtest/struct.RunResult.html) structure. It contains the final result of the processing message and other messages created during the execution.

For example, we can check the init message processing result by ensuring the log is empty and the program doesn't reply or send any messages.

To do this, we can use the `assert!(res.log().is_empty())` command.

- Contains empty log (the program doesn't reply and does not send any messages):

    ```rust
    assert!(res.log().is_empty());
    ```

- Was successful:

    ```rust
    assert!(!res.main_failed());
    ```

After confirming the successful initialization message, we process the next messages through the `handle` function. To test this, we can send the next message using the `program.send(2, String::from("Hello"))` command.

```rust
let res = program.send(2, String::from("Hello"));
```

Here, we'll confirm if the program replied with the expected hello message. We can accomplish this by utilizing the `Log` structure from the `gtest` library and constructing the anticipated log.

To create the expected log, we'll use the command `Log::builder().dest(2).payload(String::from("Hello"))`.

After creating the expected log, we can then check if the received log contains the expected log. We'll use the `assert!(res.contains(&expected_log))` command.

```rust
let expected_log = Log::builder()
    .dest(2)
    .payload(String::from("Hello"));
assert!(res.contains(&expected_log));
```

In this case:

- `dest` represents the account where the program sends a message
- `payload` contains the content of the message


Run the test to ensure everything works correctly.
