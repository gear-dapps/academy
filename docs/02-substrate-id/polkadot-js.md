The Polkadot.js browser extension is the original application created by Parity Technologies for managing Substate accounts. This method involves installing the Polkadot.js plugin and using it as a "virtual vault" that's separate from your browser to store your private keys and sign transactions.

1. You can install the extension via the following links:

    - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polkadot%7Bjs%7D-extension/mopnmbcafieddcagagdcbnhejhlodfdd?hl=en)
    - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-extension)

2. Open the extension by clicking on the logo in the menu bar.

3. Click the large plus button to create a new account. Alternatively, you can navigate to the smaller plus icon in the top right and select "Create New Account".

4. Save the seed phrase in a safe place using the security advice at the beginning of this article.

    Specify the name of your account and a strong password for making transactions. Click "Add the account with the generated seed".

    Specify the name of your account and a strong password for making transactions. Click "Add the account with the generated seed".

:::note

The password that you choose here will be used to encrypt this account's information. You will need to re-enter it when attempting to process any kind of outgoing transaction, or when using it to cryptographically sign a message. This password is stored locally on the browser extension.

:::

You've now successfully created a new account using the Polkadot.js browser extension.
