**Substrate ID** (also known as SS58) is a unique identifier used to represent an account's address in the Substrate ecosystem.

It's essential for ensuring the security and accuracy of data transfer between members of the Substrate ecosystem. The Substrate ID comprises a prefix that denotes the network and a public key that serves as the basis for the account's address.

The Substrate ID also helps maintain data integrity, as each account's address must be unique across the network. It's also used to identify the account owner across various services and applications running within the Substrate ecosystem.

To get started, select the most convenient way for you to create an account, either through a browser extension or a mobile application. Below, you'll find detailed instructions on how to create an account using either method.
