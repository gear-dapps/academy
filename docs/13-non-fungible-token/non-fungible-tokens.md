This lesson focuses on Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and their unique properties in proving digital asset ownership.

Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, offer a unique way to prove digital asset ownership. While traditional fungible tokens are interchangeable and store a value, NFTs carry cryptographic certificates that demonstrate the owner's authority over an asset, like digital art or gaming assets.

The main functions of the contract of such tokens are similar to fungible tokens:

- `transfer(to, token_id)` is a function that allows you to transfer a token with the `token_id` number to the `to` account. Unlike the fungible token contract, this contract does not require a from the account, since each token has its own owner.
- `approve(approved_account, token_id)` is a function that allows you to give the right to dispose of the token to the specified `approved_account`. This functionality can be useful on marketplaces for auctions. When the owner wants to sell his token, they can put it on a marketplace/auction, so the contract sends this token to the new owner.
- `mint(to, token_id, metadata)` is a function that creates a new token. Metadata can include any information about the token: it can be a link to a specific resource, a description of the token, etc.
- `burn(from, token_id)`: This function removes the token with the mentioned `token_id` from the contract.
