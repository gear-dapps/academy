By reading this tutorial, one can learn how to use an escrow smart contract in a blockchain transaction, which adds safety for both parties involved in the transaction. This lesson explains how an escrow smart contract works in a transaction, from the agreement of terms to the automatic transfer of funds to the seller's digital wallet.

An Escrow is an arrangement for a third party to temporarily hold the assets of a transaction. The assets are kept in the third-party account and are only released once all agreement terms are met. Using an escrow account in a transaction adds safety for both parties.

Encoding an escrow smart contract into a blockchain enables the contract to be securely executed without traditional third parties.

## How an Escrow in Smart Contract Works

1. The Buyer and Seller agree to the escrow terms. The Seller lists an item for sale, and the Buyer pays the price agreed upon.
2. The Seller delivers the product, and the funds are held in the escrow smart contract until all conditions are met and the Buyer confirms receipt of the product.
3. Once the Buyer approves the product, the funds will be automatically transferred to the Seller's digital wallet by the smart contract.
